    <blockquote>This app is an alpha at best. Development began Aug 16th, 2016. I'll do my best to keep things working and from losing data, but I make no guarantees at this point. Bug reports, pull requests, any suggestions for improvements are all welcome.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>Just enter your weight every day (the more accurate the better, a 0.1 pound resolution scale is ideal), and all the foods you eat. Skip the specifics, and move on with your life. Food log entries like 'burger', 'cheese', 'beer', 'salad', 'carrots' are fine.</blockquote>

     <blockquote>Based on <a href='https://github.com/arielf/weight-loss'>https://github.com/arielf/weight-loss</a> this site is an easy way to log your weight, and what you eat each day. After you have enough data, (a week?) we will start crunching your data through a machine learning algorithm to give you feedback on what causes weight loss, and what causes weight gain for you.</blockquote>
