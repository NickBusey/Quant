Quantio.org
=======================

A simple way to track your quantified self, and use machine learning to extract insights.

This project is an early alpha, but will enable tracking of daily weight fluctations, and correlate those to foods eaten and activities, etc. Based on https://github.com/arielf/weight-loss

It will also hopefully eventually tie into other platforms, pulling data in for a more generalized Quantified Self overview as well.

Definitely open to ideas. Hop into #quantio on irc.freenode.net

Todo:

Remove 'days', replace with simply setting the day on inputs.
